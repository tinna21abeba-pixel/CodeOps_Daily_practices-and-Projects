### transaction.js
Contains the transaction data.

Each transaction has:

- `id`
- `customer`
- `amount`
- `type`

The `type` can be either `credit` or `debit`.
### `report.js`

Contains the functions and calculations used to process
the transactions.

It uses:

- `filter()` to separate debit and credit transactions
- `reduce()` to calculate totals
- `map()` to create formatted receipt messages
- destructuring to extract object properties
- spread syntax to create an updated transaction

### `app.js`

Imports the transaction data and report functions.

It calls the report functions and prints the final transaction
report to the console.

### `README.md`

Provides documentation about the project and explains
how the modules work.
